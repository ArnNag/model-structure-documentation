### Summary
The purpose of this project is to use structural and sequence comparison to identify SCOPe domains that are related to a user-inputted human AlphaFold model and present information about each comparison to the user on the SCOPe website.  So far, I have implemented a working prototype (note: see below for known issues) for one model structure. The prototype includes SQL tables, Java code to populate these tables, and a PHP landing page (with inline JavaScript and modifications to the TypeScript RCSB Mol* library). 


### Recreating all model structure tables from scratch

1. Download the human model structures from the AlphaFold website. (Note: AlphaFoldDB has irregular releases, and the latest at the time of writing is v4. See https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/faq for release notes.)

mkdir af2_human_v4
cd af2_human_v4
curl https://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/alphafold/latest/UP000005640_9606_HUMAN_v4.tar | tar x

2. Convert the model structures to xml. (Note: I have not written code that parses the xml files yet.)

cd /h/anagle/cif2xml
./convertallaf2general.sh /h/anagle/af2_human_v4 /h/anagle/af2_human_v4_xml
# TODO: doesn't work

3. Create the model_structure_source, model_structure, and model_structure_uniprot tables.

CREATE TABLE `model_structure_source` (
  `id` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `description` text NOT NULL,
  `date` date NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1 COMMENT='Publication source for theoretical protein structure model';

insert into model_structure_source (description, date) values ("AlphaFoldDB v4", 20220930);

) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1 COMMENT='Uniprot mappings for sequences of theoretical protein structure models';

4. Populate model_structure and model_structure_uniprot. Note: Modify the file paths in MakeDBModelStructure.java to the directories where you stored the cif, pdb, and xml files respectively. Check that the dates in the insert statement are correct. Ensure that the correct version of each Uniprot sequence is imported into the uniprot table before running.

5. Create the structure_aligner and model_vs_domain_structure_alignment table.

6. Populate model_vs_structure_alignment.
Usage:
# TODO: Write a bash script that iterates over all model structure IDs and submits them as jobs to GridEngine with the qsub command.

### Landing page
The landing page code I wrote is at /h/anagle/www/scop-boot/alphafold/alphafold.php
To access the test model I've been testing on, go to https://strgen.org/~anagle/scop-boot/alphafold/alphafold.php?name=AF-P63000-F1
(This is referred to in my notebook as pdb_rowcol_fill.php)

### Search functionality
We will eventually need to implement search functionality where users can input a Uniprot accession number. This will require a landing page for Uniprot accessions and all associated model structures. There are some Uniprot accessions numbers in the AlphaFoldDB download that have several "fragments" because the sequence was too long to generate at once (See https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/download).

### Checking DBREF records
It would also be a good idea to include all associated PDB chains on the Uniprot entry landing page. These are stored in the pdb_chain_dbref table. PDB DBREF records may contain errors and do not specify which Uniprot version they refer to, so I wrote code that uses the Levenshtein distance to see whether the region of the Uniprot sequence referred to by the DBREF records approximately matches the PDB chain sequence.
# TODO: Usage, output format

### Known issues
1. The original Mol* viewer has a sequence view that allows you to view the full SEQRES sequence and click on the residues in the sequence to locate them in the structure and select regions of sequence in Selection Mode.
# TODO: link to what this is supposed to look like, describe how it disappeared
2. The AlphaFold model is colored by PAE by default, but when I make a component of the hit region, it becomes orange.
3. Unstable awk code
4. BLAST gaps
